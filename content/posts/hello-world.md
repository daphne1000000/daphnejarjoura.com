This is my first post. I'm starting to learn in public.

The goal here is simple: document what I learn as I learn it. Not polished tutorials, not expert takes — just honest notes from someone figuring things out.

## What I'm currently learning

- **NumPy fundamentals** — working through the [100 NumPy exercises](https://github.com/rougier/numpy-100)
- **Linear algebra** — the math underlying ML, via 3Blue1Brown and practice
- **ARENA curriculum** — a structured path into AI safety research

## Why learn in public?

1. Writing clarifies thinking
2. It creates accountability
3. It might help someone else on a similar path

More soon.
